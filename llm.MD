LLM, which stands for Large Language Models, plays a significant role in the development of Machine Learning (ML) in various ways:

Large Language Models (LLMs) play a significant role in the development of Machine Learning (ML), especially in the open-source branch, due to the following reasons:

1. **Enhanced Natural Language Understanding:**
   - LLMs, such as GPT-3, excel in natural language understanding, allowing developers to create more sophisticated and context-aware applications. This is crucial in various ML tasks, including natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and chatbot development, where accurate comprehension of human language is essential.

2. **Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning:**
   - LLMs provide a powerful base for transfer learning. Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks with smaller datasets, enabling developers to leverage the general knowledge captured by these models and adapt it to more specialized applications. This reduces the need for massive amounts of task-specific labeled data.

3. **Open-Source Collaboration:**
   - Many LLMs, including those developed by OpenAI, are released as open-source projects. This encourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the ML community. Developers worldwide can access and contribute to the codebase, fostering innovation and accelerating the pace of ML research and application development.

4. **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation:**
   - LLMs enable rapid prototyping and experimentation in ML projects. Developers can quickly test ideas, explore different approaches, and assess the feasibility of various applications without starting from scratch. This accelerates the development lifecycle and allows for more agile and iterative processes.

5. **Democratizing Access to Advanced ML:**
   - By open-sourcing LLMs, access to advanced ML capabilities becomes more widespread. Small and medium-sized businesses, startups, and individual developers can leverage these models without the need for extensive resources. This democratization of technology ensures that a broader range of stakeholders can participate in and benefit from the advancements in ML.


After 4 years when first time I tried to train GPT2 now it is comming Open source LLM

Try yourself [notebook](https://github.com/len-sla/GPT_finetuned_with_own_text/blob/main/LlamaIndex_RAG.ipynb). This one with LLM was finetuned with pdf indexing two books about 
Human Microbiota  in Health and Disease to be sure that topics are not covered by general content of LLM

as llamaindex was undegoing update I had to use temporary legacy imports
