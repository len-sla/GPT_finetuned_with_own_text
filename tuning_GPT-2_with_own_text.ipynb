Collaborate and Build Team\n","\n","Leaders who want to lead effective teams must be able to get along with people who are not as experienced or as smart as they are. That means making it a point to spend time with and work with people who are like themselves, and not judging them because they have different backgrounds.\n","\n","In developing a team, leaders need to be careful not to make everyone feel like a member of the team. That can lead to resentment and division. Instead, create opportunities for team members to bond and develop their own ideas. That can help employees share ideas and differentiate themselves, and it will lead to more collaboration down the road.\n","\n","For example, let’s say your boss expects a team member to be efficient and effective at all times. You could, for example, give her some tasks that she is not suited for and ask her to work on something that she would like to do but cannot due to a business need. She might be able to do this for a few hours, then decide that she can’t do that for another few weeks. That would be a good result for the team.\n","\n","Of course, you cannot treat everyone equally. It is the responsibility of the leader to ensure that all members of the team are doing their jobs with professionalism and respect. If that is not the case, then the leader must make sure that the team has opportunities to grow and learn, both on and off the clock. If that does not happen, then it is the responsibility of the team to ensure that the individual is in line with the rest of the team.\n","\n","If you have a high level of trust within the team, then it will help to give the team members the opportunity to develop their own ideas and ask questions of the leader. The team might not get the chance to grow big and strong, but it will continue to learn and improve. And if the team members do not develop their own ideas and ask questions of the leader, then the leader will be held accountable if the ideas they come\n","====================\n","Modern  leader
